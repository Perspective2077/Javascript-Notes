Notes are Made by Monkey so Wrong knowledge / gramer could exist

I commented many lines of code so u not get confused

I am assuming u know how to run a code inside your local machine (computer duh) . If not first download Node.js env from googoo then install it in your pc 

For running a file , either u can use "Run"->"Run Without debugging" option on top nav of vs code or use "node yourfilename.js"(for node env duh)

I live in mumbai(i don't) so u could find spaces between comments confusing so add them by yourself (duh)

Tell me if u found something confusing plzz tell me because i made this notes that even i can understand 

plz inform any wrong knowledge / grammar if u see one at vdhayal336@gmail.com 

Note : Plz Try Learning things in github only because i might update notes as per requirement

Still if u make your mind to download these , so keep eyes on updates and Feel free to delete this README.md file from zip file, if it's irritating u (i deleted it)
